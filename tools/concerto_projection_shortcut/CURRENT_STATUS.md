# Concerto Shortcut Current Status

This file is the single entry point for the current state of the shortcut
investigation.

## Current Bottom Line

- Strongest supported claim:
  - The released Concerto `enc2d` objective admits a strong coordinate shortcut.
- Scope of that claim:
  - Objective-level evidence on `ARKitScenes`.
  - The ScanNet continuation proxy shows measurable but limited downstream
    relevance.
  - It does not support the stronger claim that most of Concerto downstream gain
    is explained by the coordinate shortcut.
- Current action:
  - Move from critique to a minimal fix: coordinate projection residualization.
  - The local `projres_v1` chain was stopped during prior cache extraction.
  - Resume on the H200 server from the handoff document.

## Documentation Policy

- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` is the canonical high-level status document.
- When a stage finishes, the corresponding `results_*.md` / `results_*.csv`
  file should be updated and linked here.
- If a stage is still running, its current state is tracked here with the
  primary log path.

## ARKit Full Causal Branch

Source:
- [results_arkit_full_causal.md](./results_arkit_full_causal.md)

Key numbers:

| experiment | enc2d last | delta vs baseline |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| baseline | 5.9470 | 0.0000 |
| coord_mlp | 6.4204 | +0.4734 |
| global_target_permutation | 6.4563 | +0.5093 |
| cross_scene_target_swap | 6.4526 | +0.5056 |
| cross_image_target_swap | 6.4873 | +0.5403 |
| coord_residual_target | 7.2936 | +1.3466 |

Interpretation:
- `coord_mlp` remains surprisingly competitive.
- Strong correspondence corruption hurts, but not catastrophically.
- This supports a `correspondence-induced coordinate shortcut` /
  `scene-coordinate cache shortcut` reading.
- The current `coord_residual_target` implementation is not yet a successful fix.

## Corrected Stress Test

Source:
- [results_arkit_full_stress_corrected.md](./results_arkit_full_stress_corrected.md)

Key numbers:

| checkpoint | clean | local_surface_destroy | z_flip | xy_swap | roll_90_x |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| baseline | 3.453537 | 3.897785 | 3.980001 | 3.450245 | 3.845464 |
| coord_mlp | 3.536469 | 3.544549 | 3.620394 | 3.537728 | 3.601248 |
| coord_residual_target | 3.628110 | 4.223210 | 4.181930 | 3.624020 | 4.302245 |

Interpretation:
- The original branch is more sensitive to geometry destruction and scene-frame
  transforms.
- `coord_mlp` is much flatter under these perturbations.
- This is consistent with weaker dependence on local geometry.

## ScanNet Downstream Status

Status:
- The original / coord_mlp / no-enc2d / no-enc2d-renorm continuation proxy is
  finished enough for the current decision.
- The safest readout is "downstream effect is real but limited."
- The next gate is not another critique arm; it is whether the projection
  residual fix can match or beat original Concerto on ScanNet linear.

What was confirmed:
- The dataset path and weights are usable.
- A single-GPU safe smoke run reaches actual training:
  - historical path: `exp/concerto/scannet-proxy-official-origin-lin-safe-smoke/train.log`
- The official ScanNet linear gate now completes on the safe single-GPU path:
  - historical path: `exp/concerto/scannet-proxy-official-origin-lin/train.log`
  - final `Val result: mIoU/mAcc/allAcc = 0.1752 / 0.2467 / 0.6167`
  - checkpoints:
    - `exp/concerto/scannet-proxy-official-origin-lin/model/model_best.pth`
    - `exp/concerto/scannet-proxy-official-origin-lin/model/model_last.pth`

Previous failure mode:
- The original 2-GPU official gate crashed repeatedly in the distributed spawn path:
  - historical path: `tools/concerto_projection_shortcut/logs/scannet_gate.launch.log`
- The previous `no-enc2d-renorm` full post-train test aborted while writing
  `.npy` outputs because of local disk pressure. Validation metrics are still
  usable.

Current interpretation:
- The blocker is not the basic dataset path.
- The old blocker was the multi-GPU `mp.spawn` path on this machine.
- For current work, use the validation-only ScanNet linear config to avoid the
  full-test disk failure path.
- On the H200 server, run the `projres_v1` fix chain described in
  [HANDOFF_PROJRES_V1.md](./HANDOFF_PROJRES_V1.md).

## Active Downstream Jobs

Running now:
- No `projres_v1` job is currently running on this machine.

Stopped job:
- The local `projres_v1` chain was stopped during Stage 1 prior cache
  extraction.
- Log:
  - `/mnt/urashima/users/minesawa/concerto_shortcut_runs/projres_v1/logs/run_projres_v1_chain_20260415_131727_setsid.log`
- It produced logs only. No selected prior, smoke checkpoint, continuation
  checkpoint, stress csv, or ScanNet linear result was produced.

Expected next stage:
1. Move to the H200 server.
2. Run setup checks and chain dry-run.
3. Launch `run_projres_v1_chain.sh` with `GPU_IDS_CSV=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`.
4. Report the selected prior, selected alpha, stress result, and ScanNet linear
   gate result.
